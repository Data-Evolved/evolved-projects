# Project Folders

* **esp8266-projects**: Projects related to using C and MicroPython for programming the ESP8266 microcontroller. This projects will include an Internet of Things (IoT) for sensor information gathering that can feed into data science models. Some projects will be vision based with opencv, YOLO and offloading some of the work to a Raspberry Pi.
* **[Introduction to Statistical Learning](intro-to-statistical-learning) (Book)**: This will contain select translation of material from R into Python. Please find the book's web site and more information available here: http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/.

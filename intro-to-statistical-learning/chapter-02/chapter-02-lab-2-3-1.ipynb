    "# 2.3 Lab: Introduction to ~~R~~ Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3.1 Basic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will work through some basic commands in Python that mirror the functionality that we need in R. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has native structures for storing data, but other libraries are used for more advanced data structures and data manipulation. The 2 most popular ones and an additional library to help with R data sets are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `numpy` (NumPy) is a package for scientific computing with powerful arrays. https://numpy.org/\n",
    "* `pandas` is a library for high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html\n",
    "* `statsmodels` a library that can be used to load R data sets and replicate some of the functionality in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common graphic libraries used within Python are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `matplotlib` is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. https://matplotlib.org/\n",
    "* `seaborn` is a library for making statistical graphics in Python and is built on top of matplotlib. https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The main library used for statistics and machine learning is: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `sklearn` (scikit-learn): a library for machine learning https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be mapping the functionality between R objects and functions to Python objects and structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Imports\n",
    "In R, we use the `library` function to import objects, functions, and data into the local namespace for usage. In Python, we will use the `import` statement to import libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few built-in libraries that we can use along with third-party libaraies. Many of the third-part libraries have common used aliases that can be confusing for beginners to remember or to lookup. Most of the examples will not use an alias for the library to reduce confusion (and future conflict as alias are social conventions and not enforced, restricted mutual exclusive designations).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also import specific classes from a namespace directly into the local namespace so you do not have to deep reference them. This is used sparingly where it improves code readability and ensures not conflicts within the local namespace. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** \n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import sklearn  # specific namespace import\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV  # single class import\n",
    "\n",
    "# now the SearchGridCV class is referencable by the full namespace or the class namespace\n",
    "sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV(estimator = None, param_grid = {})\n",
    "GridSearchCV(estimator = None, param_grid = {})\n",

    "### Vectors, Arrays, and NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are 1-dimensional arrays that hold primitive data types (generally) and can dynamically resize (shrink or grow) as needed.

    "[1] 1 6 2 \n",
    "\n",
    "y = c (1, 4, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can using the `typing` library to optionally annotate the typing of the data type of list. Typing is only annotation or documentation. It does not enforce the data type. Each element in the list can have a different data type. You can see the style guide about type hinting and annotations and where it can be useful and where it can be duplicative."

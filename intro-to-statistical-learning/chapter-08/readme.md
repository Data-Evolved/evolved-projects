# Chapter 8: Tree-Based Methods 


## Labs 

8.3.1 [Fitting Classification Trees](chapter-08-lab-8-3-1.ipynb)

8.3.2 [Fitting Regression Trees](chapter-08-lab-8-3-2.ipynb)

8.3.3 [Bagging and Random Forests](chapter-08-lab-8-3-3.ipynb)

This lab uses the `Boston` data set and fits a regressor. I will be adding an additional lab to fit a classifier. 

8.3.4 [Boosting ](chapter-08-lab-8-3-4.ipynb)

This lab uses the `Boston` data set and fits a regressor. I have added an XGBoost example. I will be adding an additional lab to fit a classifier.
